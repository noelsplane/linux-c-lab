# Linux, Shell, and C Lab

## Overview
This repository contains my work for the Ubuntu Linux, Shell Scripting, and C programming lab.

## Structure
- 'command-line/': Logs from command-line tasks.
- 'shell-scripts/': Shell scripts for automation.
- 'c-programs/': C programs with compilation.

## Testing and Running
- **Command Line:** Used `ls`, `cd`, `chmod`, etc., in codespaces. See `easy-log.txt`, etc.
- **Shell Scripts:** Tested `easy-script.sh` with input, `file-count.sh` with directories.
- **C Programs:** Compiled with `gcc`. Ran `contacts.c` to manage contacts.
- **Project:** `project.sh` compiles and runs `contacts.c`, logs output.

## Challenges and Learnings
- Learned Git commits and debugging C with `gdb`.
- Challenges: File permissions and pointer syntax.
